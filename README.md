# MusicRecommender

The goal was to make a music recommender application with the entire project team split into a front-end and a back-end team. The project dynamically makes recommendations to the user according to their personal preferences, making use of OpenAPI. I acted as the project manager for the front-end team. 

## Walkthrough
This walkthrough describes how the application is meant to function when back-end is online. <br />
Dynamix's home page starts off prompting for user log-in info or registration. <br /><br />

<br />
Upon creating a new user profile, Dynamix provides a list of genres for the user to select their preferences. From those genre preferences, a list of songs will be generated in order to once again have the user select their preferences from those songs. <br /><br />

<br />
Once both surveys are completed, the user will be presented with a final list of recommendations. If the user previously created their profile, logging into Dynamix will bring them to this page. At any point after logging in, the user can click on their username at the top to navigate to any of the pages in order to generate new results. <br /><br />
